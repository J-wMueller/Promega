In my setup I'm using a custom cut 16 3/8" x 16 3/8" x 1/4" mirror with half inch radius corners.
The mirror ended up being 5.99mm thick which is too thick for the regular bed clips.

I designed these clips to go between the bedframe and the heat bed and hold the mirror in place on top.
The mirror is pretty heavy as it is so this is really just a little bit of additional piece of mind.

I printed the clips in Black Inland PETG with 0.5mm nozzle, 0.25mm layer height and 30mm/s speed.
