This document explains how to set the correct configurations for this machine.

The sys folder contains a set of files, most of them should not be modified.
Some of them are machine generated, like for example the heightmap.csv file.
Here is the list of files the user can change and an overall guide on how to
configure those files. Each of those files has detailed instructions in them
under which circumstances and how that particular file has to be modified.

All the files the user should ever have to change start with the prefix machine_.
All other files can be changed, but should not be.

More in-depth guides and walkthroughs can be found on the Promega Docs website:

File			         Description
A Instruction.txt        This document
machine_access.g         Handles the name of the machine as well as its IP address
machine_axisdimension.g  Sets the minimum and maximum extent of the three axis
machine_axissteps.g      Sets the step size for the three axis
machine_bedmesh.g        Defines the size and density of the bed mesh
machine_xxx_tools.g      Defines the tools for the compound or K'tana extruder, depends on file
machine_endstoptypes.g   Defines the type of end stops used in the printer
machine_extruderstep.g   Sets the step size for the extruders
machine_maxtemp.g        Sets the maximum temperatures for the bed and hot ends
machine_steppercurrent.g Sets the motor and idle currents
machine_stepperspeed.g   Sets the accelerations, max linear speeds and speed changes
machine_zendstop.g       Sets the Z height of the Z end stop
machine_zprobe.g         Defines the type of Z probe used and its offsets

Initial setup:

Step 1 needs to be done on a computer with an SD card reader and a text editor the rest will be done in the System Editor in the Settings section of the Web UI.  Follow the instructions in the individual machine_ files mentioned below.

1. Set the machine name and IP address in machine_access.g
2. Set the Z probe type and offsets in machine_zprobe.g
3. Set the Z height of the Z end stop in machine_zendstop.g
4. Deploy Z Probe
5. Run a G32 command to calculate the bed mesh
6. Repeat from step 3 and recheck values if necessary

If the UI shows all the heaters at 2000C, go into the file machine_compound_tools.g and change the H2 to H1 in the three M563 commands in that file.  Then restart the printer (make sure the bed is homed).

At this point in time, your printer should be ready for the first test print.
